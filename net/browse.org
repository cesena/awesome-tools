    Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of popular WWW search engines and other
    artifacts of power. It reclaims google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index, slashdot
    and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where
    they belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.
